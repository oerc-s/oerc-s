# Collapse Hash Request

**Subject:** OERC-S Collapse Hash Request

---

Hi,

We're developing OERC-S, an open settlement protocol for space-based energy. We'd like to ask your team to publish one real Collapse hash from a test environment. Attached are the spec (PDF) and a one-pager explaining the Intent-Frame-Collapse flow. No meeting needed—just one hash proves interoperability.

Best regards
