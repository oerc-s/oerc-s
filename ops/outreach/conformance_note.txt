OERC-S Conformance Note
========================

What Conformance Means
----------------------
A conformant implementation produces identical Collapse hashes for
identical inputs. This ensures any two systems—regardless of vendor,
language, or platform—can verify each other's settlement records.

Conformance is binary: your implementation either produces the correct
hash for all test vectors, or it does not. There are no partial passes.

Conformance Vectors
-------------------
Test vectors are published at:

  https://github.com/oerc-s/conformance-vectors

Each vector contains:
  - Intent JSON
  - Frame JSON
  - Expected Collapse hash (SHA-256)

Running Conformance Check
-------------------------
1. Clone the conformance-vectors repository
2. Feed each Intent + Frame pair to your implementation
3. Compare output hash to expected Collapse
4. All vectors must pass

Command example (using reference implementation):

  oerc-s conformance-check --vectors ./conformance-vectors/

Report results to: conformance@oerc-s.org

One hash. One test. That's all we ask.
