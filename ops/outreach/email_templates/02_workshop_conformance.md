# Conformance Workshop

**Subject:** OERC-S Conformance Workshop

---

Hi,

As space-based solar power moves toward procurement phases, interoperability becomes critical for multi-vendor integration. OERC-S provides a settlement layer that any system can implement—testable against published conformance vectors.

We're offering conformance workshops where your team can validate implementations against the OERC-S test suite. This ensures your systems can settle energy receipts across vendor boundaries from day one. The attached conformance note explains the process, and the spec PDF provides full technical detail.

Would your team be interested in a conformance testing session?

Best regards
